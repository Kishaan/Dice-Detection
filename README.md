# Dice-Detection

Computer Vision project in which traditional computer vision techniques are used to determine the location and numbers of pips on the top side of the dice from a video.

Input: Video files of a hand throwing some dice on a tray which is kept on a table. The videos may contain tricky hand movements, different lighting conditions, noise, and transparent dice (made of glass). 

Output: Detection of every dice location and the number of pips on the top face of each die after they settle down on the tray
